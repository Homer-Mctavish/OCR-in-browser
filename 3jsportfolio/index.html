        <h2>📜 Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Hi there! My name is Sam, and I am a skilled software developer with a passion for machine learning and data visualization applications, as well as software quality assurance frameworks and tools like Kubernetes. In my professional career, I have worked on a variety of projects, from developing web applications to building custom machine learning models.
        </p>

        <p>
          My expertise includes not only writing code for these applications, but also understanding the underlying data structures and algorithms that make them work. I have developed machine learning models using libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch and have also used programming languages like Python, JavaScript, and Java to create custom data visualization frameworks.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you are interested in learning more about my background and experience, feel free to take a look at my portfolio website, where I showcase some of my recent projects. You can also reach out to me through the contact information provided on my site.
